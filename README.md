Known bugs (won't be fixed)
- choosing Com vs Com as first mode removes ability to place ships on subsequent games
- drag ship from very edge of brder will cause it to be stuck onto mouse
- drag ship offscreen will cause slight shift in correct snap position
- sometimes snap to outside box
- hardcoded solution to random bug where computer hasHit prop is true but they hadn't hit anything
